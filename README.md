**Description**:  
This repository is a comprehensive collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects designed to develop practical skills in system administration, penetration testing, and vulnerability exploitation. It includes projects focused on Windows Server security, Active Directory (AD) exploitation, web application vulnerabilities, network scanning, and advanced tool usage like Burp Suite, Metasploit, and BloodHound. Each project is structured to provide real-world scenarios, enabling learners to master both defensive and offensive cybersecurity techniques.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Windows Server Security**:  
  - Build and secure a Windows Server environment with Active Directory.  
  - Perform penetration testing using Mimikatz, CrackMapExec, and BloodHound.  
  - Join Windows 10/11 clients to the domain and test access controls.  
- **Web Application Vulnerabilities**:  
  - Exploit vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.).  
  - Solve Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on TryHackMe ("Root Me," "Pickle Rick," "Mr. Robot").  
  - Develop custom Python-based Nmap scanners and GoBuster automation scripts.  
- **Advanced Tool Usage**:  
  - Master Burp Suite through PortSwigger Academy labs.  
  - Use Metasploit for exploitation, payload generation, and post-exploitation.  
  - Create reverse shell payloads with MSFvenom and write custom Metasploit modules in Ruby.  
- **Network Scanning and Exploitation**:  
  - Conduct Nmap scans on Metasploitable and other vulnerable environments.  
  - Use SearchSploit to find and leverage CVEs for exploitation.  
  - Perform privilege escalation and lateral movement in AD environments.  

**Technologies and Tools Used**:  
- **Windows Server**: Active Directory, DNS, Group Policy.  
- **Penetration Testing Tools**:  
  - Burp Suite: Web vulnerability scanning and exploitation.  
  - Metasploit: Exploitation, payload generation, and post-exploitation.  
  - Mimikatz: Credential dumping and privilege escalation.  
  - BloodHound: AD relationship visualization.  
  - CrackMapExec: SMB and LDAP exploitation.  
- **Scripting and Automation**:  
  - Python: Custom Nmap scanners and reverse shell payloads.  
  - Ruby: Custom Metasploit modules and scripting.  
  - Bash: Automation scripts for directory brute-forcing and security monitoring.  
- **CTF Platforms**: TryHackMe, OWASP Juice Shop.  

**Who Is This Repository For?**  
- Cybersecurity professionals looking to enhance their practical skills.  
- Ethical hackers and penetration testers focusing on real-world scenarios.  
- System administrators securing Windows Server and Active Directory environments.  
- Students and enthusiasts preparing for certifications like OSCP, CEH, or CompTIA PenTest+.  
- Developers interested in scripting and automation for cybersecurity tasks.
