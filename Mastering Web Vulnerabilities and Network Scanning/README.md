**Description**:  
This project is a hands-on exploration of web application vulnerabilities, network scanning, and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. It focuses on developing offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills through practical tasks, including vulnerability identification, professional reporting, and scripting. The project features exercises with OWASP Juice Shop, TryHackMe CTF challenges ("Root Me," "Pickle Rick," and "Mr. Robot"), and the development of a custom Python-based Nmap scanner.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Web Vulnerabilities**:  
  - Exploit vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop, including Broken Access Control, XSS, CSRF, and more.  
  - Use tools like Burp Suite, Dirb, and GoBuster for reconnaissance and exploitation.  
- **Network Scanning**:  
  - Perform Nmap scans on Metasploitable to detect services and vulnerabilities.  
  - Develop a custom Python-based Nmap scanner for efficient network analysis.  
- **CTF Challenges**:  
  - Solve TryHackMe challenges like "Root Me," "Pickle Rick," and "Mr. Robot" to practice privilege escalation, reverse shells, and password cracking.  
- **Automation**:  
  - Create a GoBuster Universal script for automated directory brute-forcing.  

**Technologies and Tools Used**:  
- **OWASP Juice Shop**: A vulnerable web application for practicing exploits.  
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and service detection.  
- **TryHackMe**: Platform for CTF challenges and hands-on learning.  
- **Python**: Scripting for custom tools and automation.  
- **GoBuster**: Directory and resource brute-forcing.  
- **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanning and exploitation.  

**Who Is This Project For?**  
- Cybersecurity enthusiasts looking to improve their offensive and defensive skills.  
- Penetration testers and ethical hackers seeking hands-on experience with web vulnerabilities and network scanning.  
- Developers interested in creating custom security tools and scripts.  
- Students and professionals preparing for certifications like OSCP, CEH, or CompTIA Security+.
