**Description**:  
This project focuses on developing advanced cybersecurity skills by mastering two of the most powerful tools in the field: **Burp Suite** and **Metasploit**. Through hands-on labs, controlled testing, and custom scripting, this project covers web vulnerability exploitation, payload generation, and penetration testing techniques.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Burp Suite Proficiency**:  
  - Complete 10+ labs from PortSwigger Academy to master SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, OS command injection, and more.  
  - Perform controlled security tests on real websites using Burp Suite tools.  
- **Metasploit Framework**:  
  - Exploit vulnerabilities in Metasploitable and other practice environments.  
  - Generate and obfuscate payloads using MSFvenom.  
  - Use SearchSploit to find and leverage CVEs for exploitation.  
- **Custom Scripting**:  
  - Learn Ruby basics and write custom Metasploit modules.  
  - Develop reverse shell payloads in Python, Bash, and EXE formats.  
- **Practical Exploitation**:  
  - Gain root access on Metasploitable using 5 different methods.  
  - Create and deploy reverse shells for remote access.  

**Technologies and Tools Used**:  
- **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and testing.  
- **Metasploit Framework**: Exploitation, payload generation, and post-exploitation.  
- **MSFvenom**: Payload creation and obfuscation.  
- **SearchSploit**: Exploit database searching and CVE utilization.  
- **Ruby**: Scripting for custom Metasploit modules and automation.  
- **Python/Bash/EXE**: Reverse shell payload development.  

**Who Is This Project For?**  
- Cybersecurity professionals looking to deepen their expertise in Burp Suite and Metasploit.  
- Ethical hackers and penetration testers seeking hands-on experience with exploitation techniques.  
- Students and enthusiasts preparing for certifications like OSCP, CEH, or CompTIA PenTest+.  
- Developers interested in writing custom scripts and modules for cybersecurity workflows.
