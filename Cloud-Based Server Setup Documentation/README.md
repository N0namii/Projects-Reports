**Description**:  
This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a secure cloud-based server for a startup. It covers the configuration of strong authentication measures, firewall setup, Fail2Ban protection, and the installation of the Apache2 web server. The server is designed to allow SSH key-based authentication while disabling password-based logins for enhanced security. Additionally, the server is protected by a firewall that only allows necessary ports, and Fail2Ban is configured to prevent brute-force attacks.  

The project also includes automated scripts for user setup and security monitoring, as well as a Docker-based reverse proxy solution using Apache2.  

**Key Features**:  
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Disable password-based login and configure SSH key access for secure remote connections.  
- **Firewall Configuration**: Use UFW and AWS security groups to restrict access to essential ports (21, 22, 80).  
- **Fail2Ban Protection**: Set up Fail2Ban to block IPs after repeated failed login attempts.  
- **Apache2 Web Server**: Install and configure Apache2 to serve web content.  
- **Automated Scripts**:  
  - **User Setup Script**: Automates the creation of new users, SSH key generation, and access configuration.  
  - **Security Notification Script**: Monitors system logs for suspicious activity and sends email alerts.  
- **Docker + Apache2 Reverse Proxy**: Implement a reverse proxy solution using Docker and Apache2 to manage web traffic.  

**Technologies Used**:  
- **SSH**: Secure remote access.  
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**: Firewall configuration.  
- **Fail2Ban**: Brute-force attack prevention.  
- **Apache2**: Web server setup.  
- **Docker**: Containerization for web applications.  
- **Bash Scripting**: Automation of user setup and security monitoring.  

**Who Is This Project For?**  
- System administrators setting up secure cloud servers.  
- Developers looking to automate server configuration tasks.  
- Startups and small businesses needing a secure and scalable server setup.  
- Anyone interested in learning about server security and automation.
